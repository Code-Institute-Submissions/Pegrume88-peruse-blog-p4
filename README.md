# Design

### Overall feel
The overall feel I want to give to this application is a clean simple design
## Wireframes and Initial Design
This were my innitial design ideas. There are some changes due to authorised users 
having a slightly defferent view to un authorised users:

![wireframes](/static/image/Peruse.png)

# Features

## Current Features

### Navigation menu displayed across all pages

The navigation menu is displayed on all pages. and is when viewed
on a mobile device the nav bar links colapse in a dropdown menue.
The nav bar will display different options depending on where a user
is logged in or not.

### User acount registration

This page allows users to register with the application to view 
all the options available for authorised users.

### User create Profile 

This allows the user to create a profile, they can add a profile picture
as well as a bio and links to thier social media

### Crud Functionality
 the user can add create, delete and edit their posts as well as view all posts.
 the admin can read, add, delete and edit a users profile, account setting, posts and comments.

### Possible Future Features

A possible feature could be to allow useres to view a post with the most likes
to follow which posts are trending. 
Another feature could be for the suer to choose a selections of categories in which they are interested, allowing their feed to only show categores the user wants to see.

### Defensive Design Features

The defensive features that I have added revolve around if a user has regestered,
If you the user is logged in then they can add posts, comment, and like posts. As well creating a profile page and edit their account setting.

Users can only edit and delete their own posts.


### Categories

Users can view posts under a specific category via a dropdown menu located
in the nav bar. 

If the user is logged in they will be able to add their own categories.

# Testing

### Manual testing
I manually went through the application and it features to manually test all links and pages.
All links and pages run correctly and there were know errors diplayed.

### Automated testing
Due to time constraints I was only able to create one automated test.
I tested the validation of the post form. And the form ws validated.

# Validators

## Python

I ran all python files through PEP8 to validate the files. 
The errors that were found were mostly about line length.


## CSS

I rand all css through the WS3 css validator with no Errors

## Javascript

I only used A couple of lines of JS in my application to allow fors to grab the correct user information.

I ran the JS through JShint with errors.

## LightHouse

![LightHouse](/static/image/lighthouse.png)

The light house test didnt show the best results for porformance. In fact it was extremely poor. I tried to improve the result but i didnt see much of an improvement. With more time i possibly could get this score up to a respectable level.

There rest of the scores are respectable but but other than best practices they could all be improved.

## Deployment

I used Render to deploy my code due to the changes With Heroku which lead with me being unable to register. 

Rander makes it really easy to Deply. Once you connect your GitHub or GitLab account to your Render account, Render will automatically build and deploy your services with every push. For more information on connecting your Git accounts to Render, see our docs for GitHub and GitLab.

### Connecting GitHub

When you create your first service on Render you will have the option to connect GitHub.

Clicking on Connect GitHub will redirect you to github.com where you can authorize Render to access your repositories. You will then be redirected back to Render where you will see a list of your GitHub repos. You can then proceed by clicking on the repo youâ€™d like to use for your service.
